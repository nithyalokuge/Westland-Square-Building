# Westland Square - Interactive Digital Media MSc

Westland Square is a building within Trinity College Dublin, home to the Interactive Digital Media MSc program.

When we first applied to the course, we expected to study on the main Trinity College campus, as there was no mention of Westland Square.

Our project aims to bridge this information gap, ensuring that future applicants have a clear understanding of where they will be studying.

This group project is part of the **"Authoring for Digital Media" module (CS7026)** of the **MSc in Interactive Digital Media** at **Trinity College Dublin**.
